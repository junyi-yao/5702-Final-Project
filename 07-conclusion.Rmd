# Conclusion

Firstly, we believe the proportion of the population that go to college is increasing, though we don't have enough data to make this conclusion. Similar proportion of male and female hold a bachelor's degree, while more women have some college experience.

Secondly, it is very clear that education is having a very significant impact on personal income. This has been consistent during the years of our data source(2008-2014).

Finally, we are very surprised to see how personal income differs for men and women with the same educational attainment. In specific, men with a bachelor's degree are much more likely to earn high income, while women with less than high school degree are much more likely to earn no income. This is a persistent issue during the years of our data source.
