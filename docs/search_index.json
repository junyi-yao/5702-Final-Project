As a result, there seems to be increasing number of people going to college in these years. Recently, however, I have seen articles claiming that the return of a college degree has been decreasing, due to increased tuition and increasing proportion of the population getting higher education. Its been very common to hear stories of people who have tens of thousands of dollars student loan but dont make that much income. So is college degree depreciating? Im wondering if college degree is still making much difference in peoples income nowadays. So we got the data about education and income for California residents between 2008 and 2014. Our result shows that education still has a very significant impact on personal income, and this impact is consistent, which means a college degree is not depreciating. Surprisingly, we found that there is a huge and persistent gap between the male and female population: While similar proportion of men and women went to college, significantly larger proportion of male with a bachelors degree make high income than their female counterparts. By contrast, a much larger proportion of female with no high school degree make no income than their male counterparts. The result was very shocking to me because I was under the impression that male and female are paid equally in the U.S. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We got out data from Californias open data portal: https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ca-educational-attainment-personal-income/resource/26201f19-4469-4311-a819-bbbd3e557eda. Each row contains Year, Age, Gender, Educational Attainment, Personal income, and the number of people with the characteristics specified in the row. example for the data source "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 we only focus on people aged 18 to 64 for the following reasons: 3.2 We also make plots based on percentage of population", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 we only focus on people aged 18 to 64 for the following reasons: Most children and elders dont make any income, and this is not affected by educational attainment and gender, which are the key variants we are studying for. There are missing data for age group 0 to 17 and over 65. But no missing data for population aged 18 to 64(see the missing data section). 3.2 We also make plots based on percentage of population We dont want our data to be affected by the size of different populations. When we compare the population with respect to gender and educational attainment, we always compare the percentage of the specific population that make high(or low) income. When we compute the difference between genders, we always compute the difference in percentage(not in numbers). "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values There are some missing values in our dataframe, we want to look into the missing values and see if there is any pattern. Firstly, we want to know how many of our rows contain missing values. We can see that the only column that is missing is the Population.Count. Only 34 rows have missing values. But does the missing value has any pattern? Is the missing value related to any other variables? From the plots above, we cannot see patterns of the missing values with respect to Year or gender. However, We can see that the majority of the missing values are for people from 0 to 17 years old. Only 1 row for people aged over 65 is missing, and none of the rows for people between 18 and 64 is missing. So we are not surprised to see that the majority of the missing information are for people with no income and classified as Children under 15. Then, we want to find what percent of rows are missing for each age group: We can see that a large proportion of data for residents aged 0 to 17 are missing. Very small percent of data is missing for 65 and older. No data is missing for people aged between 18 and 64. Finally, we use the combined plot to show the patterns: The large plot in the middle shows the pattern of the missing values. The grey cell means the corresponding variable is not missing, while the purple cell means the corresponding variable is missing. The bar plot in the upper part shows the percent/count of rows that does not have the corresponding variable. The bar plot on the right shows the percent/count of rows that have the corresponding pattern of missing values. The results agree with our plots made before: Only Population.Count column is missing, and the majority of the rows in our dataset does not contain any missing values. In conclusion, the only column that contains missing values is Population.Count. A large proportion of data are missing for people aged 17 years old or younger. In addition, it doesnt make much sense to analyze income for people aged below 18. Therefore, our project will mainly focus on the data for people aged between 18 and 64. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results Firstly, lets see the education attainments for male and female below. Slightly larger proportion of women got bachelors degree or more. More women got some college degree(less than 3 years),while more men got high school or equivalent. But is it true that larger proportion of the population are getting higher education nowadays? From our limited data, we can see that there was a slight decrease in the proportion of population that get a bachelors degree in 2011 and 2012, probably due to the financial hardship caused by the financial crisis in 2008. But the proportion soon got back and increased in 2013 and 2014. Its hard to make a conclusion with our limited data but we believe the proportion is increasing. Then we explored the proportion of male and female that make different income with a specific degree. It is very clear that the proportion of high-incomers increases as degree advances. However, it is surprising to see such a huge gap between the proportion of male and female bachelors that make the highest income. Then we filtered out the population that makes the highest income to see the distribution of their education. its not surprising to see most of the high-income population hold a bachelors degree or more, while that proportion is slightly larger for females. For no-incomers: we can see that much larger proportion of female no-incomers did not complete their high school education. We are then interested in male and females that hold a bachelors degree. How much do male and female bachelors earn? ## $title ## [1] &quot;Distribution of income for male and female bachelors&quot; ## ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;labels&quot; It is very clear that males with a bachelors degree are much much more likely to earn high income than their female counterparts! Now we want to see this for different educational attainment: We found that this situation is not only true for bachelors. For every educational attainment, we can see much more males with the highest income and more females make no income. We then also made alluvial diagram and stacked bar chart that give the same result: We can see clearly that most of males that hold a bachelors degree or more earn high income, while most females who have less than high school degree make no income. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Firstly, we believe the proportion of the population that go to college is increasing, though we dont have enough data to make this conclusion. Similar proportion of male and female hold a bachelors degree, while more women have some college experience. Secondly, it is very clear that education is having a very significant impact on personal income. This has been consistent during the years of our data source(2008-2014). Finally, we are very surprised to see how personal income differs for men and women with the same educational attainment. In specific, men with a bachelors degree are much more likely to earn high income, while women with less than high school degree are much more likely to earn no income. This is a persistent issue during the years of our data source. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
