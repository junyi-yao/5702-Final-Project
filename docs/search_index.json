As a result, there seems to be increasing number of people going to college in these years. Recently, however, I have seen articles claiming that the return of a college degree has been decreasing, due to increased tuition and increasing proportion of the population getting higher education. Its been very common to hear stories of people who have tens of thousands of dollars student loan but dont make that much income. So is college degree depreciating? Im wondering if college degree is still making much difference in peoples income nowadays. So we got the data about education and income for California residents between 2008 and 2014. Our result shows that education still has a very significant impact on personal income, and this impact is consistent, which means a college degree is not depreciating. Surprisingly, we found that there is a huge and persistent gap between the male and female population: While similar proportion of men and women went to college, significantly larger proportion of male with a bachelors degree make high income than their female counterparts. By contrast, a much larger proportion of female with no high school degree make no income than their male counterparts. The result was very shocking to me because I was under the impression that male and female are paid equally in the U.S. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We got out data from Californias open data portal: https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ca-educational-attainment-personal-income/resource/26201f19-4469-4311-a819-bbbd3e557eda. Each row contains Year, Age, Gender, Educational Attainment, Personal income, and the number of people with the characteristics specified in the row. example for the data source "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 we only focus on people aged 18 to 64 for the following reasons: 3.2 We also make plots based on percentage of population 3.3 We replace the class name in educational attainments and income with shorter ones", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 we only focus on people aged 18 to 64 for the following reasons: There are missing data for age group 0 to 17 and over 65. But no missing data for population aged 18 to 64(see the missing data section). Most children and elders dont make any income, and this is not affected by educational attainment and gender, which are the key variants we are studying for. 3.2 We also make plots based on percentage of population We dont want our data to be affected by the size of different populations. When we compare the population with respect to gender and educational attainment, we always compare the percentage of the specific population that make high(or low) income. When we compute the difference between genders, we always compute the difference in percentage(not in numbers). 3.3 We replace the class name in educational attainments and income with shorter ones In this way there will be less overlap in plots so that we can observe the plots better. Concretely for educational attainments, &gt;=Bachelor represents Bachelors degree or higher, College (&lt;4year) represents Some college, less than 4-yr degree, =High school represents High school or equivalent and &lt;High school represents No high school diploma. Also for income, [75k,inf) means $75,000 and over,[50k,75k) means $50,000 to $74,999 and likewise. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values There are some missing values in our dataframe, we want to look into the missing values and see if there is any pattern. Firstly, we want to know how many of our rows contain missing values. We can see that the only column that is missing is the Population.Count. Only 34 rows have missing values. But does the missing value has any pattern? Is the missing value related to any other variables? From the plots above, we cannot see patterns of the missing values with respect to Year or gender. However, We can see that the majority of the missing values are for people from 0 to 17 years old. Only 1 row for people aged over 65 is missing, and none of the rows for people between 18 and 64 is missing. So we are not surprised to see that the majority of the missing information are for people with no income and classified as Children under 15. Then, we want to find what percent of rows are missing for each age group: We can see that a large proportion of data for residents aged 0 to 17 are missing. Very small percent of data is missing for 65 and older. No data is missing for people aged between 18 and 64. Finally, we use the combined plot to show the patterns: The large plot in the middle shows the pattern of the missing values. The grey cell means the corresponding variable is not missing, while the purple cell means the corresponding variable is missing. The bar plot in the upper part shows the percent/count of rows that does not have the corresponding variable. The bar plot on the right shows the percent/count of rows that have the corresponding pattern of missing values. The results agree with our plots made before: Only Population.Count column is missing, and the majority of the rows in our dataset does not contain any missing values. In conclusion, the only column that contains missing values is Population.Count. A large proportion of data are missing for people aged 17 years old or younger. In addition, it doesnt make much sense to analyze income for people aged below 18. Therefore, our project will mainly focus on the data for people aged between 18 and 64. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results Firstly, does education have a big impact on peoples personal income? There is very clear correlation between educational attainment and personal income: People with higher degree are more likely to make higher income. Since education does make a positive impact on peoples personal income, are more people getting higher education nowadays? From our limited data, we can see that there was a slight decrease in the proportion of population that get a bachelors degree in 2011 and 2012, probably due to the financial hardship caused by the financial crisis in 2008. But the proportion soon got back and increased in 2013 and 2014. Its hard to make a conclusion with our limited data but we believe the proportion is increasing. We then start to wonder if educational attainment is different for male and female: do females generally study more? we can see that only slightly larger proportion of women got bachelors degree or more. More women got some college degree(less than 3 years),while more men got high school or equivalent. Then we explored the proportion of male and female that make different income with a specific degree. It is very clear that the proportion of high-incomers increases as degree advances. However, it is surprising to see such a huge gap between the proportion of male and female bachelors that make the highest income. Then we filtered out the population that makes the highest income to see the distribution of their education. its not surprising to see most of the high-income population hold a bachelors degree or more, while that proportion is slightly larger for females. We are then interested in male and females that hold a bachelors degree. How much do male and female bachelors earn? It is very clear that males with a bachelors degree are much much more likely to earn high income than their female counterparts! Now we want to see this for different educational attainment: We found that this situation is not only true for bachelors. For every educational attainment, we can see much more males with the highest income and more females make no income. We then also made alluvial diagram and stacked bar chart that give the same result: We can see clearly that most of males that hold a bachelors degree or more earn high income, while most females who have less than high school degree make no income. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component In this part, we utilize three types of interactive plots to further explore our data. In all the static plots in Results, it is hard to see how the ratio changes as time goes. Therefore, we first make interactive line plots to see how income proportion is distributed in different years. Following three plots are for all gender, male and female respectively. You can place your mouse at the point to see the exact data (year, ratio and class for income). You can zoom the plot by choosing the area you want and return to the whole plot by double clicking. Also, you can remove or restore any line by clicking the legend on the right. From the first plot, we can observe a very interesting phenomena: the proportion of No Income increased sharply from 2009 to 2012 for more than 3%. Recall that previously we found that there was a slight decrease in the proportion of population that get a bachelors degree in 2011 and 2012. We suspect that the drop in bachelors degree is attributed to financial situation negatively affected by the financial crisis in 2008. People who were to achieve bachelors degree or planned to go university failed to do so because of their worsened financial situation. After 2012, when the ratio for most classes still decreases or does not change much, there is a sharp increase in the proportion of earning the most (more than 75k). As we can see, a small amount of people was all of a sudden much richer, probably benefiting from investment or property management during the crisis. To continue exploring whether gender counts in the trend of income distribution, we draw the same plot for female and male separately. Generally, the distribution follows the same pattern for two genders. Also we can again clearly observe that women earns much less than men all the time. Also we can explore the ratio variation for different income on different years by plotting out bar charts (both the stacked bar charts and grouped bar charts). The graph can be accessed by https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/junyi-yao/STAT5702/blob/main/nplot1.html. We can select to display grouped bar charts or stacked ones by choosing the button on the left top. Also we can play around with different class of income by clicking buttons on the top right to decide the categories shown in the plot. As can be seen in the plot, the distribution of different classes of income remains stable on the whole. The class of No Income has the largest proportion while the class of $5000 to $9999 contains the smallest population. Despite the fact that both the proportion of different educational attainments and income classes does not change to a large extent as time goes, we still attempt to find some pattern between them. In such way we can know how college degree affected income in these years. Therefore we created a interactive bar chart that displays changes from year to year. We can choose the class of income and select among different years to see how how the population with different educational attainments distributes under same class of income. The default is the highest class $75,000 and over and the first year 2008. For instance, we can fix the income class as $75,000 and over and click year button by sequence. Then we can observe that more and more people had higher education attainments (despite 2009 when the ratio of bachelor decreases a little bit, probably affected by financial crisis). It indicates that education matters and is positively related to earning big money. Surprisingly, when we fix the income class as No income, we found that the proportion of people without high school diploma decreased and at the last three years, there were approximately same ratio of people with (not including college and bachelor) and without high school diploma have no income. In other words, ratio of people with no income also had higher educational attainment. Therefore, possessing high school (or even higher) diploma was having less and less guarantee for income. Proportion of Income for Different Education $75,000 and over $50,000 to $74,999 $35,000 to $49,999 $25,000 to $34,999 $15,000 to $24,999 $10,000 to $14,999 $5,000 to $9,999 No Income 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Finally we try to observe in the global scope (including all subjects) an we choose parallel coordinate plot. The graph below is a parallel coordinate plot of different characteristics. You can switch the order of the bars clicking and holding the name above the bar(Year, Gender, etc) and drag it around. You can also filter the results by selecting a proportion of the bar. Something we found interesting about this plot, is the result when we filtered on Population.Count. If you select the largest Population.Count(by selecting the few blue lines on top of the bar Population.Count), you will find that the largest group for all years are always males with a bachelors degree and the highest income. By contrast, if you look for females with the same conditions:bachelors degree and highest income, youll find much smaller group sizes.This result shows that not only the proportion of high income male and female bachelors are different, but also the size of them are very different. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Firstly, we believe the proportion of the population that go to college is increasing, though we dont have enough data to make this conclusion. Similar proportion of male and female hold a bachelors degree, while more women have some college experience. Secondly, it is very clear that education is having a very significant impact on personal income. This has been consistent during the years of our data source(2008-2014). Also, we are very surprised to see how personal income differs for men and women with the same educational attainment. In specific, men with a bachelors degree are much more likely to earn high income, while women with less than high school degree are much more likely to earn no income. This is a persistent issue during the years of our data source. The proportion of No Income increased sharply from 2009 to 2012, which was probably affected by the financial crisis and it matches with decrease in the proportion of population with bachelors degree in 2011 and 2012. Meanwhile, a small amount of people was all of a sudden much richer after the period. Finally, from the variation of relation between diploma and income subject to year, we found that education was becoming more and more important in earning big money. At the same time, possessing certain diploma was having less and less guarantee for income.
