# Data transformation


## we only focus on people aged 18 to 64 for the following reasons:

1. There are missing data for age group 0 to 17 and over 65. But no missing data for population aged 18 to 64(see the missing data section).

2. Most children and elders don't make any income, and this is not affected by educational attainment and gender, which are the key variants we are studying for.



## We also make plots based on percentage of population

We don't want our data to be affected by the size of different populations. When we compare the population with respect to gender and educational attainment, we always compare the percentage of the specific population that make high(or low) income. When we compute the difference between genders, we always compute the difference in percentage(not in numbers).
